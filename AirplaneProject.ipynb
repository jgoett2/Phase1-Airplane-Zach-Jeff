This data details the make, models, weather conditions, flight phases, injuries, and deaths during each accident.  The data could potentially help organizations find correlations, and identify conditions of an airplane flight that make it safer.  \n",

    "2. Accidents that occur during **taxi**, **takeoff, and landing have the lowest  fatalities.  Accidents that occur during maneuvers and cruise phases have the highest fatality rates. \n",
